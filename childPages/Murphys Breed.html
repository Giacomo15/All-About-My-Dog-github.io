    <h3>
      Murphy is a cute dog, so you are probably wondering where to steal him, and also what you are looking for when you steal him.
    </h3>
      <h4>
        Murphys breed is a long name... He is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.
      </h4>
    <h3>
      <p>When my family was looking for a dog back in 2013 my mom wanted one that would not bark a lot and was mostly a lap dog.
        So when my mom found out on Nat gio wild that there was a questionare for looking for the right dog breed, my mom was all for it.
        She found that the Cavalier was the best for familys who wanted an easy dog to look after. So that is how we chose Murphy... A questionare.
      </p>
    <h4>
        When we wanted to look for where to get Murphy, the closest place to get him was in Guelph, Ontario. So we had to fly him to Edmonton.
        (Btw this was all happening in secrecy from me, because my mom wanted it to be a suprise for mothers day long weekend.)
